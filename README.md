# FluxNodeUptimeMonitor

A tool to check Fluxnode uptime and benchmark status.

The [Flux](https://runonflux.io/) network is created by individual Flux owners running [FluxNodes](https://www.runonflux.io/flux-nodes.html) on the network. In order to get rewarded for providing a node to the network nodes need to be online and meet benchmark requirements which are tested every few hours. 

FluxNodeUptimeMonitor lets users enter their wallet address and check their node uptime and benchmarks status.
